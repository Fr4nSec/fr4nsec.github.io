## Objectives

- Obtain the system flag (root)

## Recon

Let's scan the target IP address.. 

Suggestion: keep your work organized and get records of what you are finding, like saving the results of nmap into a file that you can read later on. I the capture you will see i add '> InitialScan' or 'PortScan' and that's the way i keep track of what i ennumerate, a part of my screenshots.

```
nmap -p- -sS --min-rate 5000 -n -P <IP Address>
```

## Exploitation

We can use Hydra to brute force HTTP-POST-FORM:


```
hydra -l <user> -P <password list> <IP Address> ssh
```



## Privilege escalation

Let's check if sudo has any additional configuration..

```
sudo cat /root/root.txt
```

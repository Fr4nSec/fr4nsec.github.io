## Objectives

- Obtain the system flag (root)

## Recon

Let's scan the target IP address.. 

Suggestion: keep your work organized and get records of what you are finding, like saving the results of nmap into a file that you can read later on. I the capture you will see i add '> InitialScan' or 'PortScan' and that's the way i keep track of what i ennumerate, a part of my screenshots.

```
nmap -p- -sS --min-rate 5000 -n -P <IP Address>
```

There you can find that FTP will accept anonymous logons, we see there is a robots.txt in the port 80, another HTTP service in the port 10000 and a SSH service running under a non-default port (55007).

Let's start by checking what's in that FTP server.

We find a hidden file that we can download using mget. If you're unsure of what command to use you can type 'help' at the ftp console to see available commands.

It looks like the text is rotated (seen in other CTF) and for that we can use 'ROT13' (Google it).

It seems the creator of this CTF is trying to mess with us a little bit since there is nothing interesting here, so let's jumpt to the robots.txt that we found earlier.

There is a number of listed sites there and some numbers that seems to be a decimal encryption. In Google you can find different online tools to convert to text. I used v2.cryptii.com.

And we got another encryption, but this one looks like base64.

And another one. This looks more like a hash. If you're unsure of what kind of hash, you can use crackstation.net and that we can crack using John.

The creator of this page IS making fun of us by giving useless information. ( At the time of finding this i didn't know it was useless ).



## Exploitation

We can use Hydra to brute force HTTP-POST-FORM:


```
hydra -l <user> -P <password list> <IP Address> ssh
```



## Privilege escalation

Let's check if sudo has any additional configuration..

```
sudo cat /root/root.txt
```
